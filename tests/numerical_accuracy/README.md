# Numerical-accuracy certification

Tests here certify StatsPAI's numerical kernels against **published,
multiple-precision *certified* reference values** — not against R/Stata output
(`tests/reference_parity/`) or against recovered population parameters.

## Why this is a separate directory

The JSS manuscript headlines a fixed count of `tests/reference_parity/` tests as
the cross-language / DGP-recovery parity evidence, and a count-drift guard
(`tests/test_jss_validation_api.py`) pins it. NIST StRD certification is a
*different* kind of evidence (certified-value numerical accuracy), so it lives
here to keep that headline count meaningful and stable.

## Current suites

- **`test_nist_strd_ols.py`** — NIST/ITL Statistical Reference Datasets (StRD)
  Linear Least Squares regression. All 11 datasets (Norris, Pontius, NoInt1/2,
  Filip, Longley, Wampler1–5) are bundled verbatim under
  `_fixtures/nist_strd/` (see that directory's `PROVENANCE.md`). The tests read
  the embedded certified coefficients / standard errors and check the
  `ols_fit` kernel and `OLSEstimator` covariance against them, plus a
  QR-beats-normal-equations guard on the ill-conditioned designs.

- **`test_nist_strd_anova.py`** — NIST StRD one-way Analysis of Variance. All 11
  datasets (SiRstv, SmLs01–09, AtmWtAg) are bundled verbatim under
  `_fixtures/nist_strd_anova/` (see its `PROVENANCE.md`). A one-way ANOVA is OLS
  of `y ~ C(group)`, so these certify the F-statistic / R² / sum-of-squares
  numerical accuracy of `sp.regress`. Backed by the mean-centred
  (Frisch-Waugh-Lovell) OLS fit, `sp.regress` matches the certified F to
  machine precision through the average-difficulty family (incl. n=18009); the
  three highest-difficulty designs (`SmLs07/08/09`, 9 constant leading digits)
  reach the irreducible IEEE-754 float64 floor (~7e-5) of their data and are
  checked at a documented 1e-3 tolerance — not a silent gap.
