"""Equivalence + correctness guard for the vectorised Mahalanobis distance
matrix in ``optimal_match``.

The per-treated-unit Python loop was replaced with ``scipy.cdist`` (~3-5x
faster, lower memory). This test pins the new path to the exact reference
formula ``sqrt((x-y)' VI (x-y))`` to machine precision so the speed-up cannot
silently change which controls get matched.
