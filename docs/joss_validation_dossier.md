# JOSS Validation Dossier

This dossier collects reviewer-facing evidence for StatsPAI's readiness as
research software. It is intentionally factual and reproducible.

## Project Status

- Repository: <https://github.com/brycewang-stanford/StatsPAI>
- Package archive: <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.19933900>
- PyPI: <https://pypi.org/project/StatsPAI/>
- License: MIT, with a plain-text `LICENSE` file in the repository.
- Current release at the time of this dossier: `1.16.0`, released on
  2026-05-29.
- Public GitHub repository creation date: 2025-07-26.
- Public repository activity signals as of 2026-06-01: 212 stars, 39 forks,
  23 GitHub releases, and 1 public external user issue in addition to
  maintainer-created issue/PR activity.

## Software Scope

StatsPAI exposes a unified Python interface for causal inference and applied
econometrics. As of release `1.16.0`, the registry reports 1,020 public
functions across 81 submodules:

```bash
python scripts/registry_stats.py --check
```

The registry and schema layer are part of the public surface. They support
programmatic discovery through `sp.list_functions()`, `sp.describe_function()`,
and `sp.function_schema()`.

## Validation Assets

The repository includes several independent validation tracks:

- Unit and integration tests across the main estimator families.
- R parity modules under `tests/r_parity/`.
- Stata parity modules under `tests/stata_parity/`.
- Reference-parity checks under `tests/reference_parity/`.
- Original-paper replay fixtures under `tests/orig_parity/`.
- Monte Carlo coverage checks under `tests/coverage_monte_carlo/`.
- Snapshot tests for publication-table output under `tests/output_snapshots/`.
- Citation and bibliography audits under `tools/`.
- Reviewer-facing offline examples under `examples/`.

The archived local full-suite report records:

```text
5200 passed, 98 skipped, 13 deselected, 1 xfailed, 2 xpassed
```

on Python 3.9.6 for the default local suite as of 2026-05-17. The exact report
is stored in `test_results_full_suite.md`.

## Parity And Replication Anchors

StatsPAI includes validation fixtures for common teaching and replication
benchmarks, including:

- Card-style returns-to-schooling IV estimates.
- LaLonde / Dehejia-Wahba job-training benchmarks.
- Lee-style close-election regression discontinuity.
- Callaway-Sant'Anna difference-in-differences examples.
- California Proposition 99 synthetic-control examples.

Known convention differences are documented in parity reports rather than
hidden. For example, bandwidth selectors, regularisation constants, small-sample
standard-error conventions, and fold-split randomness are recorded in the
R-parity report where they affect exact numerical matching.

## Double Machine Learning Parity

`sp.dml` is StatsPAI's port of the Double/Debiased Machine Learning framework
(Chernozhukov et al., 2018). Because the canonical reference implementations
are the `DoubleML` packages for R and Python (Bach, Chernozhukov, Kurz,
Spindler & Klaassen), `sp.dml` is pinned against **both** so the numerical
claim is auditable from either ecosystem.

The fixture is a fixed seed-42 DGP (`n=1000`, `p=10`, true effect `θ=0.5`) at
`tests/reference_parity/_fixtures/dml_data.csv`. All three engines consume the
same CSV. On the Python side, `sp.dml` and `doubleml-for-py` are given
**identical** scikit-learn nuisance learners (`LassoCV(cv=5)` for regression,
`LogisticRegressionCV(cv=5)` for the binary propensity) and the same fold
partition under a fixed seed, so any divergence reflects a genuine
implementation difference rather than learner choice or split noise.

All four DoubleML model classes are pinned against `doubleml-for-py`.
The non-instrumented models (PLR, IRM) use `dml_data.csv`; the
instrumented models (PLIV, IIVM) use the companion `dml_iv_data.csv`
(n=2000, continuous instrument `z_c`, binary instrument `z_b`).

| Model | `sp.dml` (StatsPAI 1.16.1) | `doubleml-for-py` 0.11.3 | `DoubleML` R 1.0.2 (cv.glmnet) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **PLR** (continuous D) | +0.559022 ± 0.033103 | +0.559022 ± 0.033103 | +0.536759 ± 0.033498 |
| **IRM** (binary D, AIPW ATE) | −0.019107 ± 0.076561 | −0.026658 ± 0.074206 | +0.006640 ± 0.074434 |
| **PLIV** (continuous D, instrument) | +0.511701 ± 0.019453 | +0.511701 ± 0.019453 | — (Python-side pin) |
| **IIVM** (binary D, instrument, LATE) | +0.549467 ± 0.092426 | +0.561773 ± 0.091915 | — (Python-side pin) |

- **PLR matches `doubleml-for-py` to machine precision.** Under shared learners
  and folds the point estimate and standard error agree to within one float64
  unit in the last place: |Δ coefficient| = 1.1 × 10⁻¹⁶ and |Δ standard error|
  = 1.4 × 10⁻¹⁷. This is exact numerical equivalence, not a loose tolerance —
  both implementations evaluate the same Neyman-orthogonal score on the same
  cross-fit partition. The corresponding deviation from the R reference is
  ~4.1% on the coefficient, attributable to `cv.glmnet`'s penalty path
  differing fractionally from scikit-learn's `LassoCV`; the R fixture is pinned
  to within 7% relative.
- **IRM agrees within one-tenth of a standard error.** `sp.dml` and
  `doubleml-for-py` differ by 0.0076 on the ATE (≈ 0.10 SE on this fixture);
  all three implementations are statistically indistinguishable from zero, the
  truth for this DGP. The residual difference comes from internal AIPW
  score-construction details — it is verified *not* to be driven by propensity
  trimming (matching the clip thresholds leaves it unchanged) nor by IPW
  normalization (toggling `normalize_ipw` leaves it unchanged). The external
  parity test pins this at < 0.05 absolute.

Both directions are exercised by committed tests, not just asserted in prose:

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[dev,parity]"   # the parity extra adds doubleml-for-py
python -m pytest tests/external_parity/test_dml_python_parity.py -v   # sp.dml vs doubleml-for-py (machine precision)
python -m pytest tests/reference_parity/test_dml_parity.py -v          # sp.dml vs DoubleML R (needs local R + DoubleML)
```

The Python-side check runs whenever `doubleml-for-py` is installed (via the
`parity` extra) and skips cleanly otherwise; the R-side check additionally
requires a local R installation with `DoubleML` 1.0.2 + `mlr3learners` 0.14.0.
Environment of record for the numbers above: StatsPAI 1.16.1, `doubleml-for-py`
0.11.3, scikit-learn 1.7.2, and `DoubleML` R 1.0.2 on R 4.5.2 with `cv_glmnet`.
The API mapping between `sp.dml(model=...)` and the DoubleML classes, plus the
full divergence discussion, is in `docs/guides/sp_dml_vs_doubleml.md`.

## Research Use

At submission time, StatsPAI is being used in working-paper workflows connected
to the Stanford Rural Education Action Program and related empirical policy
evaluation work. No peer-reviewed research article using StatsPAI has yet been
published. The current impact claim is therefore based on credible near-term
research use, reproducible validation materials, public package distribution,
and reviewer-verifiable examples rather than published downstream citations.

## Public Distribution And Community Signals

StatsPAI is publicly distributed on PyPI and archived on Zenodo. The GitHub
repository has public stars, forks, issue templates, a dedicated support
discussion channel, contribution instructions, support instructions, release
notes, and CI status checks. These are treated as community-readiness and
public-interest signals, not as evidence of independent scholarly adoption.

The public fork list is available through GitHub at
<https://github.com/brycewang-stanford/StatsPAI/forks>. As of 2026-05-29, the
GitHub API reported 37 forks, all owned by normal GitHub `User` accounts. The
project does not infer downstream research use from those forks unless a user
opens an issue, pull request, citation, or reproducible report that documents
such use.

## Commercial Downstream Disclosure

StatsPAI Inc. is the legal entity associated with the project. CoPaper.AI is a
commercial downstream product that may call the MIT-licensed StatsPAI package.
The StatsPAI package itself is permanently open source under the MIT license.
This is an open-core / commercial-downstream arrangement: the research software
submitted to JOSS remains open, while commercial products can build on it under
the same license terms available to all users.

## Reproducible Checks

From a repository checkout:

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[dev,plotting]"
python -m pytest tests/test_ols.py tests/test_did.py tests/test_registry.py -q --no-cov
python scripts/registry_stats.py --check
python scripts/schema_quality.py
python tools/audit_bib_duplicates.py --strict
python tools/audit_bib_coverage.py --strict-dangling --hide-orphans
python -m build
python -m twine check dist/*
```

`docs/joss_reviewer_guide.md`.
