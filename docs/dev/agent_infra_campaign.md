# Agent-Infra Campaign

> Work line: branch `agent-infra`, **physically isolated** from the JOSS paper review
> ([joss-reviews#10604](https://github.com/openjournals/joss-reviews/issues/10604)).
> Goal: make the agent-native surface (registry / schema / result objects / MCP
> result cache / DSL plumbing) *solid* — not the estimators, not the paper.

## JOSS isolation contract

A change on this branch is **safe for the paper review** iff it does **not** touch
any of these four classes of artifact:

1. `paper.md` / `paper.bib`
2. The **numerical output** of any estimator (`.estimate` / `.se` / `.ci` /
   coefficient tables of `did iv rd synth dml panel …`).
3. The reference-/external-parity expected numbers
   (`tests/reference_parity/`, `tests/external_parity/`).
4. The **existing signature or default behavior** of any public function
   (new params/methods may be *added* only with defaults equal to current behavior).

Every commit on this branch is audited against this contract before merge.
Metadata-only changes (registry specs, schema plumbing, additive result methods,
MCP runtime cache, tests) are all in-bounds: they describe or wrap the estimators,
they do not change a single estimated number.

## Item #1 — schema↔signature drift

**Problem (measured 2026-06-09).** Of 224 hand-written `FunctionSpec`s, a CI-grade
audit found two *agent-breaking* invariant violations:

- **Invariant A** — spec advertises a parameter the function cannot accept
  (param not in signature, and no `**kwargs` to absorb it): **21 functions**.
  An agent that reads the schema and calls with that kwarg gets a `TypeError`.
- **Invariant B** — a *required* signature parameter is missing from the spec
  (agent omits it → `TypeError`): **15 functions** (overlapping set).

Root cause: hand-written specs duplicated the param list, then signatures evolved
(e.g. `metalearner` spec said `treatment`/`method`; the signature — and the spec's
own `example` — use `treat`/`learner`).

The 4 genuine `**kwargs` dispatchers (`synth`/`iv`/`dml`/`did`) are *correctly
excluded* by Invariant A: their specs document logical params routed through kwargs.

**Fix.** (a) Add `tests/test_registry_signature_contract.py` enforcing Invariants
A & B over *all* hand-written specs, with a precise per-function failure message.
(b) Correct the ~24 drifted specs to match real signatures, preserving curated
descriptions/enums under the right param name.

**Why not a runtime reconciliation engine?** It would rewrite all 224 specs at
import time — large blast radius, opaque to a reviewer reading `registry.py`, and
it would silently drop curated enums attached to renamed params. Hand-fix + CI
guard gives the same permanence with a 24-spec diff instead of a 224-spec one.

## Item #2 — `EconometricResults` citation parity

**Finding.** The `to_dict(detail=)` half was *already* shipped
(`minimal`/`standard`/`agent` levels at `core/results.py:728`) — the earlier
audit was stale. The real gap was `.cite()`: only `CausalResult` had it, so
`sp.bib_for(regression_result)` (which duck-types on `.cite`) **raised**, and a
regression result couldn't answer the uniform agent question "cite yourself".

**Fix (additive, results.py only).** Added `EconometricResults.cite(format=)`
mirroring `CausalResult.cite`, resolving the bib key **exactly** from
`model_info['citation_key'] → model_type → method` against the shared
`CausalResult._CITATIONS` table (single source of truth, mirrors `paper.bib`).

- Zero-hallucination (§10): exact-only matching means a textbook estimator with
  no canonical paper (OLS / logit / probit / poisson) returns a
  `"% No citation registered"` placeholder rather than a fuzzy — possibly wrong —
  match. Registered methods (e.g. via `citation_key="tobit"`) resolve to the
  verified entry; APA/JSON are *derived* from that BibTeX, never generated.
- Side benefit: `sp.bib_for(result)` now works for regression results too.
- The realistic `EconometricResults` producers (regress/logit/probit/poisson)
  legitimately have no canonical paper; tobit/heckman/qreg already return
  `CausalResult` and were already cited. `model_info['citation_key']` is the
  forward hook for any future regression estimator that needs a citation.

No existing `to_dict`/`summary` output changed; `.cite()` is a pure addition.

## Item #3 — workflow-tool dispatch contract

**Course-correction.** The original plan ("register workflow tools in the function
registry") was *wrong on inspection*: `audit_result` / `sensitivity_from_result`
/ `bibtex` / … are **MCP-only tools** with no `sp.<name>` callable — they operate
on result handles. Putting them in the function registry would pollute
`sp.list_functions()` and inflate the public-symbol count that README / `docs/
stats.md` cite (a JOSS-visible surface). The single source of truth correctly
stays `WORKFLOW_TOOL_SPECS`; the fix belongs at the manifest/dispatch layer.

**Real gap found.** `execute_workflow_tool` falls through to a *silent error dict*
(`{'error': 'workflow_tool dispatch missed name ...'}`) — not an exception — when
a spec has no branch. The existing `test_every_advertised_tool_is_executable`
only checks `name in WORKFLOW_TOOL_NAMES`, so it **trusts membership** and cannot
catch a spec added without a dispatch branch: the tool is "executable" yet 500s
for a real agent.

**Fix (test-only).** `tests/test_workflow_tool_dispatch_contract.py` exercises
`execute_workflow_tool` for every spec name and rejects the fall-through sentinel,
plus locks `WORKFLOW_TOOL_NAMES == specs` and validates each spec's JSON-object
`input_schema` (type/properties/required⊆properties). Adding a spec without
wiring the dispatcher now fails CI. No production code changed; no registry count
moved → `registry_stats` untouched.

## Item #4 — result-cache TTL + reason-aware misses

**Gaps.** The MCP result cache (`agent/_result_cache.py`) was LRU-only: a handle
lived until pushed out by newer fits, so on a long-running server a `result_id`
could silently resolve to a *stale* fit after the underlying data changed. And a
miss returned bare `None` — `_need_result` couldn't tell an agent *why* (expired
vs evicted vs never-existed).

**Fix (runtime only; default behaviour unchanged).**

- **Opt-in TTL** via `STATSPAI_MCP_RESULT_CACHE_TTL` (seconds) or
  `ResultCache(ttl_seconds=)`. Default `None` = no expiry → byte-identical to the
  old behaviour. Expired entries (aged from creation = fit time) are swept lazily
  on access and eagerly on insert. Malformed / non-positive env → `None` (a bad
  var can never shrink retention to zero).
- **Reason-aware misses**: a bounded ledger (256 ids) records why a handle left
  (`ttl` / `lru` / `explicit`); `miss_reason(rid)` returns that or `unknown`.
- **New API**: `evict(rid)`, `purge_expired()`, `stats()`, plus `keys()/__len__/
  __contains__` now honour expiry.
- `_need_result` (workflow tools) now emits a *tailored* re-fit hint keyed on the
  miss reason instead of a single generic LRU message.

All additive; the default singleton `RESULT_CACHE` behaves exactly as before
unless a TTL is configured.
