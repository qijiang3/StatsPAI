"""End-to-end causal-inference workflow orchestrator.

``sp.causal(df, y=, treatment=, ...)`` stitches the full analysis
pipeline into one call: diagnose identification -> recommend an
estimator -> fit it -> run the standard robustness suite -> produce
a manuscript-ready HTML / Markdown / LaTeX report.

This module materialises the ``agent-native`` workflow as an API while
keeping each stage's statistical assumptions explicit.
